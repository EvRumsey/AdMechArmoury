Weapons tagged with this have a chance to overheat, injuring the user, when fired.

Warp Rift:
The Eldar Wraithcannon is a unique weapon that has a chance to totally destroy its target and damage all surronding

Baleful Energies:
Necron weaponry utilizes dangerous and baleful energies which have negative effects on living tissue, making using this technology hazardous to living beings, however they do have a chance of ignoring all armour

Force Weapon: 
Force weapons possess the ability to channel the users psychic talents into a potent melee attack, which is capable of incapacitating or killing the target instantly.(this only functions when weilded by a pawn with either Psychicly sensitivitive or Psychicly hypersensitivitive traits)

Pacifier:
Pacifier Weapons though various means, excel at subduing their opponents in a (Ususally) Non Lethal manner. Current types are either Psychic or Pain based

Rapid fire weapons have an increased Rate of fire (shots per burst) when firing at targets are within half of their max range.

Melta Weapons deal double damage and have double AP when hitting targets within half range

Plagued:
Plagued weapons usually blessed by grandfather nurgle, infect pawns injured by these weapons with disease.

Toxic:
Toxic weapons are usually coated with foul poisions, designed to impair and disrupt target functions.

Buckshot: Heavily based on XenoDan's Proper Shotguns mod
Weapons tagged with this do not fire single projectiles, but a cluster of pellets or buckshot

Combi Weapon: based on Jecstools abilityuseritem - there does seem to be a bug currently that causes the secondry fire button to disappear when loading a save game, usually requipping will fix this.
Combi weapons combine two weapons into a single housing, the primary weapon (Usually a bolter) functions as normal, the secondry weapon can only be fired via a button.

=== Wargear ===
Grenade Belts: based on Jecstools abilityuseritem - there does seem to be a bug currently that causes the grenade button to disappear when loading a save game, usually requipping will fix this.
Grenade belts give the wearer the ability to throw a grenade of the respective type
Grenade types:
Frag - Similar to vanillia grenades, but with slightly reduced damage and a lager radius
Krak - Similar to vanillia grenades, but with slightly reduced radius and increased damage
Melta/Tankbusta - Single cell radius, high base damage, with increased damage against buildings
Photon - These grenades cause very little damage, but stun and blind anyone withing a large area
EMP/Haywire - These grenades cause very little damage to living tissue, but play havoc with eletronic systems, they can however stun living things occasionally. 

Shield: Shield code based on Polaris Labs Core
Items with this tag generate a shield similar to the vanillia shieldbelt, however it also protects agasint melee attacks, and allows ranged weapons to be used.

Illuminator: based on Rikki's Mining Helmet mod
Items marked with this tag have a light built into them that can be set to on, off or automatic (On at night, off in the day)
